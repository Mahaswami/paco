Installation
============

AIM is currently only tested on Python 3.7+.

As AIM requires a new release of Python, you may need to
download and install a Python_ 3.7 interpreter.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install using pip, and it is recommended to do this in a virtualenv.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install aim

You should now have a CLI application named `aim`.

It is recommended for production workloads to pin the version
AIM that you are running with to the project that contains the
AIM configuration files.
