WordPress Single-Tier
=====================

The **WordPress Single-Tier** starter project creates an budget-conscious single
server WordPress site.

It is primarily intended to show you the basics of using Paco and for hands-on
experience with Paco. It can be provisioned in a single AWS account with a low cost per hour.

The documentation for this starter project exists as a Waterbear Cloud blog post,
"`Turnkey AWS with Paco - Create and Manage a WordPress server`_".
