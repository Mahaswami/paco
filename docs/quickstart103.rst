Quickstart Lab 103
==================

In this quickstart, you will take the environment built in the first two quickstarts and
add a CI/CD pipeline and monitoring and alerting. You will add to the AIM project files
from quickstart 102. If you don't have those available, or you just want to jump start
your AIM project with an app with a functional CI/CD and monitoring and alerting, the
``aim init project`` command has a starting template named ``complete-web-app`` which
will generate everything you will have at the end of this quickstart.
