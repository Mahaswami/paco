Changelog for aim
=================

3.1.0 (unreleased)
------------------

### Added

- Alarms can be provisioned at the Application level without being specific to a Resoure context.

- Route53HealthChecks can be provisioned. These are global resources with the application region
  suffixed to the health check name. The CloudFormation template and CLoudWatch Alarm are provisioned
  in us-east-1, as that is where the metrics are hard-coded to by AWS.

- Lambda template will grant Lambda permissions to an Events Rule in the same application that
  references it as a Target.

- New Events Rule template.

### Changed

- Improvements to the CLI. Verbose flag is now respected.
  Yes/no questions are consistent and can be answered with 'y', 'n', 'yes' or 'no'.
  Clean-up to formatting. Only prompt for provision changes when running the provision
  sub-command.

- ALB Alarms now provision with an `LBApplication` suffix and match the Resoruce.type field.

3.0.0 (2019-09-27)
------------------

### Added

- New directory `aimdata` is created within an AIM Project by AIM. This is used to record state
  of AIM provisioning. CloudFormation templates used to create stacks in AWS are cached as well
  as the last copy of the AIM Project YAML files. These files are used to speed up subsequent
  runs and more importantly can show you what is changed between AIM runs to make it easier to
  review new changes before they are actaully made to AWS.

- CLI: Display a diff of changes from last AIM run and new run in the AIM Project YAML configuration.
  The `-d`, `--disable-validation` flag can be used to

- CLI: Display changes and ask for verification before updating CF templates. This can be disabled
  with the `-y` flag.

- CLI: Offer to delete a stack in a CREATE FAILED state so that a new stack can be provisioned in it's place.

- AWS credentials can now be set to live for up to 12 hours. You can set the .credentials field to
 `mfa_session_expiry_secs: 43200 # 12 hours` to enable this. The default is still one hour.

- Resources with the `change_protected` flag set to true will not have their CloudFormation stacks
  updated.

- API Gateway REST API can now have models, methods and stages. It supports Lambda integration
  with either 'AWS_PROXY' via an assumed Role or 'AWS' via a Lambda Permission.

- S3Bucket has NotificationConfiguration for Lambdas. Lambda will detect if an S3Bucket within the
  same application notifies the lambda and will automatically add a Lambda permission to allow S3 to
  invoke the lambda.

- Lambda AWS::SNS::Subscription resources now have a Region property.

- CloudWatchAlarms template has a `notification_region` class attribute that can be set if
  notificationgroup subscriptions need to go to a single region.

- CloudFront has Origin ID support.

- EFS Resource support.

### Changed

- Breaking! CF Template names have beenÂ refactored so that they are more user friendly when listed in the
  AWS Console. This requires deletion and reprovisioning of AWS resources. Templates now have new
  consistent ways to create their names, so this should be the last time this change happens.

- CLI: References to NetworkEnvironments now use consistent `aim.ref` syntax, e.g.
  `aim provision netenv <ne>.<env>.<region>`

- All stacks are created with Termination Protection set.

- CF template base class `aim.cftemplates.cftemplates.CFTemplate` has new methods for creating consistent
  AWS names: `create_resource_name()`, `create_resoruce_name_join()`, `create_cfn_logical_id()`,
  and `create_cfn_logical_id_join()`.

- Console messages reworked to show relevant information in columns.

- CF template base class method `gen_parameter` renamed to `create_cfn_parameter`.

- S3 controller now relies on the bucket name to come from the S3Bucket model object.

- Lambda code.s3_bucket field can now be an aim.ref or a plain bucket name.

- You can provision without specifying the region and it will include all regions in an env.

- NotificationGroups are loaded from project['resource']['notificationgroups']

### Fixed

- CloudTrail generates it's own CloudWatch LogGroup if needed. Outputs for CloudTrail and CloudWatch LogGroup.

- APIGateway, SNSTopics and Lambda now respect the `enabled` field.

### Fixed

- snstopic output ref and lambda alarm ref fixes.

- Added IAM Users feature for creating IAM Users and configuring console access

### Added

- Moved aim reference generation into the Model. Model objects now have .aim_ref and

  which will include a complete list of all stack outputs that are referenced using the
  yaml dictionary path of the resource.

- ALB Outputs includes TargetGroup Fullname.

- Minimal APIGatewayRestApi template.

- Added external_resource support to the ACM

- Added ReadOnly support to the Administrator IAMUserPermission

### Changed

1.2.0 (2019-08-06)
------------------

### Added

- Deleting resources can leave dangling CloudFormation templates in your
  account. Controllers for NetworkEnvironments now keep track of templates
  they've provisioned and warn you about unused templates.

- NotificationGroups can be provisioned as SNS Topics and subscriptions.
  Use ``aim provision notificationgroups``.

- CloudWatch Alarm descriptions are JSON with metadata about the environment,
  region, application, resource group and resource that the alarm is for.
