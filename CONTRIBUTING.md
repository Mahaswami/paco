## How to contribute to Paco

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Paco**, and instead to communicate with the Paco authors (hello@waterbear.cloud).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/waterbear-cloud/paco/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/waterbear-cloud/paco/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Paco in the paco-cloud Gitter.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Paco documentation?**

* Please start by writing a Paco contributors document ;P

Thanks! :heart:
